 The information contained on this web page is informative.
 Informative means that the text may provide background or context to the authoritative text contained in the adopted Bluetooth specification. Informative text is not considered when determining compliance to the Bluetooth specification. Please refer to the adopted Bluetooth specification for the normative (i.e. authoritative) text used to establish compliance. Compliance issues due to errors on this web page are not the responsibility of the Bluetooth SIG and rest solely with the member.
 
The Peripheral checks if the peer device supports address resolution by reading the Central Address Resolution characteristic before using directed advertisement where the initiator address is set to a Resolvable Private Address (RPA).

 - Note:
 A device has only one instance of the Central Address Resolution characteristic. If the Central Address Resolution characteristic is not present, then it is assumed that Central Address Resolution is not supported.
