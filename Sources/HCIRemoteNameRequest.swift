/// HCI Remote Name Request
///
/// The Remote_Name_Request command is used to obtain the user-friendly name of another BR/EDR Controller. The user-friendly name is used to enable the user to distinguish one BR/EDR Controller from another. The BD_ADDR command parameter is used to identify the device for which the user-friendly name is to be obtained. The Page_Scan_Repetition_Mode parameter specifies the page scan repetition mode supported by the remote device with the BD_ADDR. This is the information that was acquired during the inquiry process. The Clock_Offset parameter is the difference between its own clock and the clock of the remote device with BD_ADDR. Only bits 2 through 16 of the difference are used and they are mapped to this parameter as bits 0 through 14 respectively. A Clock_Offset_Valid_Flag, located in bit 15 of the Clock_Offset command parameter, is used to indicate if the Clock Offset is valid or not.
///
/// When the Remote Supported Host Features Notification event is unmasked and when the Remote_Name_Request command initiates a connection, the Link Manager shall read the remote LMP features mask pages 0 and 1.
///
/// -  Note: If no connection exists between the local device and the device corre- sponding to the BD_ADDR, a temporary link layer connection will be estab- lished to obtain the LMP features and name of the remote device.
